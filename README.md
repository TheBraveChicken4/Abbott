# Abbott
Abbott is a project I came up with out of personal interest. This project is not related to any course or school work that I have completed and I have simply created this project out of my own enjoyment. With that said there may be some inaccurracies or inefficient code based off of what I wanted to get out of the project. I have hidden the personal access code and API key that is linked with my paid accounts for those services. In order to get the code to work for yourself there will be several things you have to change to fit your own wants and needs. For example visit the PicoVoice website to create and train your own wake word, then download the fild and use that in place of the file containing the wake word "Abbott". You will also need to visit OpenAI to create an account and API key. In addition, I use PicoVoice's PvPorcupine API and you will need to visit their site for your own access key as well. 

I do intend to eventually move Abbott to my Raspberry Pi 4 and have it running almost as Amazon's Alex does. I have ideas to possibly hook up LED lights, speakers and maybe even a magic mirror to increase the functionality of Abbott. Again, this project is purely out of personal interest but I do hope you find it interesting as well. In time I wish to create my own unsupervised machine learning model in place of OpenAI's API, but nothing solid has been decided on yet.
